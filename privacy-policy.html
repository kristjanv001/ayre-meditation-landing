          <p>
            This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the Ayre app

          <p>
            The app does save mindful minutes to Apple Health, which is a
            feature designed to help users track their meditation progress. We
            do not have access to this information and it is stored securely on

            The Ayre app takes data security seriously and uses
            industry-standard security measures to protect your data. All
            personal information and other data is stored securely on your
            device and is not accessible to others.
          </p>
